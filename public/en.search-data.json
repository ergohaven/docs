These are the default settings, and if this is your first time setting up RuEn, it is recommended to go this route.\nHowever, in some cases the default settings may not suit you:\nif your system uses a non-standard key combination to change the layout, see section RuEn M0 and RuEn M1M2; if you work a lot with remote machines (for example, via RDP) and you often need to synchronize the remote machine’s layout with the keyboard layout, see section RuEn M1M2; if you need to have an individual layout for each window, or if for some reason you often experience desynchronization of the keyboard layout and the system, or it is very inconvenient for you to use the RuEn Toggle, RuEn En, RuEn Ru keys for switching layouts, see section [Using the qmk-hid-host program](#using-qmk-hid-host program). It is still recommended to read this and the next section to get a general understanding of the RuEn mode, and then proceed to more complex settings.","ruen-dflt#RuEn Dflt":"When you press this key, the keyboard uses the Win+Space combination to change the layout if Mac mode is not selected. In Mac mode (turned on by the Toggle Ctl Gui key combination from the Quantum tab), the keyboard will send the Ctl+Space combination to switch layouts.\nThis mode is enabled by default. Pressing the RuEn Dflt key is necessary if another layout switching mode was previously enabled.","ruen-en#RuEn En":"For the RuEn Dflt, RuEn M0 modes it works as follows:\nif the keyboard has a Russian layout, then it sends a combination to change the layout and changes the internal state to the English layout, if the keyboard has an English layout, it does nothing. For the RuEn M1M2 mode, the operating logic changes slightly:\nif the keyboard has a Russian layout, then it sends a combination to change the layout to English (macro M1) and changes the internal state to the English layout, if the keyboard has an English layout, then it sends a combination to change the layout to English (macro M1), the internal state remains on the English layout.","ruen-m0#RuEn M0":"Allows you to change how the default layout is switched. To configure this mode, you need to perform the following steps:\nSet in the M0 macro the necessary sequence for switching the layout. For testing, you can temporarily place the M0 macro in the current layout to check its operation. Press the RuEn M0 key. After this, the keyboard will send the M0 macro instead of the default combination for switching layouts. This switching method can be useful in different cases:\nswitching the layout in the system does not coincide with the default one; there are problems with the default switching: for example, Windows and Ubuntu, when switching, briefly shows a special window with a choice of layouts, which draws the focus to itself for a few milliseconds; experimentally, in the default method, delays were selected that were sufficient for the focus of this window to disappear; Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that your system will have enough of these delays; or vice versa: the pop-up window with the layout in Windows is annoying and you want to make sure that the layout is switched using the Shift+Alt combination.","ruen-m1m2#RuEn M1M2":"Allows you to set separate macros for switching layouts to English and Russian. To configure this mode, you need to perform the following steps:\nConfigure in the system a combination of keys to enable the English layout and a combination of keys to enable the Russian layout. Set the combination to switch to the English layout in the M1 macro. Set the combination to switch to the Russian layout in the M2 macro. It is also advisable to temporarily place these macros on the current layout and debug their operation. Press the RuEn M1M2 key. After this, the keyboard, instead of the default combination to switch the layout, will send the macro M1 to enable the English layout and the macro M2 to enable the Russian layout. This mode is useful because the keyboard sends the language change combination regardless of the state of the internal layout. Thus, it turns out that there is no need to synchronize the internal state and the layout in the system: just press RuEn Ru or RuEn En once and the internal state will coincide with the layout in the system (the RuEn Sync key is not needed in this case). The RuEn Toggle key will also work, but take a closer look at the pair of RuEn Ru and RuEn En keys (believe me, it’s very convenient once you get used to it).\nThis mode can also be especially useful if you have to type text on remote machines, each of which may have its own layout state.","ruen-mod#RuEn Mod":"Switches the layout twice: when pressed and when released. Thus, by holding this key, you can enter characters and sequences from another layout.","ruen-ru#RuEn Ru":"For the RuEn Dflt, RuEn M0 modes it works as follows:\nif the keyboard has an English layout, it sends a combination to change the layout and changes the internal state to the Russian layout, if the keyboard has a Russian layout, it does nothing.

To do this, you need to insert RuEn Store at the beginning of the macro, and insert RuEn Revert at the end.","ruen-sync#RuEn Sync":"Switches the state of the keyboard layout without sending any sequences to the system.

It is useful when typing in the Russian keyboard, because… provides the ability to enter one word in the English layout and after entering it automatically switch to the Russian layout.\nThe end of a word in RuEn word mode is determined by pressing Space, Enter, Escape, Minus.\nIn addition, if the Shift key was held down before pressing RuEn word, the CAPS WORD mode is also enabled in RuEn word.\nIf you often have to type technical or mathematical texts in Russian, replete with English inserts, this mode can be a good help.\nExamples of similar text\nIP address, TCP/IP stack, OSI model variable name `helloWorld` LaTeX equations of the form $x^2+y^2=0$","synchronization-and-switching-layouts#Synchronization and switching layouts":"In order for the keyboard to switch layouts correctly, the keyboard layout must match the layout on the system. To do this, you need to follow two rules:\nFirst you need to make sure that the layout of the system and the keyboard match; in other words, you need to synchronize the layout in the system and in the keyboard. And then, so that the synchronization does not get lost, to switch the layout, use only special keys: RuEn Toggle, RuEn Ru, RuEn En. You can check your keyboard layout in the following ways:\nthe current keyboard layout can be seen on the screen (PlanetaV2, as well as K:02, K:03, Imperial44 when the Modern or Minimalistic screen mode is selected); if there is no screen, then you can determine the layout experimentally: select the English layout in the system and press the RuEn. key, if you go to ., then the keyboard has an English layout, and if you go to yu, then the keyboard has a Russian layout layout; You can also use the following consideration: when turned on, the keyboard is set to the English layout. If the layout in the system and the keyboard do not match, it is necessary to synchronize. This can be done in various ways:\npress the RuEn Sync key once; in this case, the keyboard will change the internal state without sending anything to the system; change the layout in the system using the standard combination for changing the layout; change the layout in the system by clicking the mouse on the layout icon. After you have made sure that the keyboard layout is the same as in the system, you need to check that the RuEn Toggle key simultaneously switches the layout in both the system and the keyboard.\nAlso in RuEn mode there is a pair of keys for switching the layout directly to the desired language: RuEn En and RuEn Ru. The RuEn En key switches to the English layout if the Russian layout is currently used and does not change anything if the English layout is already installed. The RuEn Ru key does the same thing exactly the opposite: it turns on the Russian layout only if the English one is currently installed.\nIt is recommended to relearn how to use the RuEn En / RuEn Ru keys to switch layouts. In this case, before you start writing, you can immediately set the desired layout. Over time, this will be done automatically, and it is faster than looking at the layout indicator in the system or writing something, then deleting it, switching the layout, and typing it again.\nAt this point, the basic setup can be considered complete. What follows is background information about the RuEn mode keys and a description of advanced modes.","using-the-qmk-hid-host-program#Using the qmk-hid-host program":"This program runs on the computer and sends various information to the keyboard:\ncurrent time, current volume level, information about the artist and the name of the playing media, current window layout.

They can do anything you want: type whole sentences, or repeat routine in-game actions.\nMacro configuration for creating combos Let’s create a macro that presses A, D, S, S, J in sequence.\nOpen Vial or use the web version, then in the top menu go to the Macros tab. In this tab you can view each available macro by clicking its number at the top of the interface. Up to 109 macros can be created.\nChoose a macro number, then click Add action in the bottom-right corner. In this example we’ll create macro M0 using the most common method: Add action, which manually adds an action to the list.\nYou can also use Tap Enter (adds an Enter key press quickly) or Record macro (records a macro directly from the keyboard).\nSelect the needed action from the dropdown and assign keys for that action. Choose the Tap action (sends a single key press, or a chord), click +, and assign the A key.\nOther available actions include Text (type a text snippet), Down (press-and-hold), Up (release), and Delay(ms) (a delay between actions).\nAdd the next action to the macro, the same way as in the previous step. Click Add action again, choose Tap, click +, and assign the key — this time choose D.\nActions are executed from top to bottom. Keep this in mind when building macros. If you need to reorder actions, use the up/down arrow buttons on the left side of the action you want to move.\nAdd the remaining actions and save the result. Just like in step 3, add key presses S, S, J to the macro.\nWhen you finish creating the macro, click Save in the bottom-right corner.\nMacros are saved to the keyboard’s internal memory and will also work on another PC. When saving a macro, Vial may ask you to unlock the keyboard by holding two keys in the top-left corner.\nAssign the created macro key to the layout. In this example, assign macro M0 to a key on Layer 3: go to the Keymap tab in the top menu, select Layer 3, select the desired key on the layout, then in the bottom Macros tab click M0.\nChoose any layer and key position that’s convenient for triggering the macro; see the layer section above for how to create layers.\nMacro configuration for typing text As an example, we’ll create a macro that opens the global chat in Counter-Strike 1.6, types \"Hello!\", and sends the message.\nTo follow this example, you need to understand the steps required to send a message to global chat in CS 1.6. By default, you open the global chat window with Y, type the message text, and press Enter to send it.\nOpen Vial or use the web version, then go to the Macros tab, select a macro number, and click Add action in the bottom-right corner. In this example we’ll create macro M1 using Add action.\nAdd the action that opens the in-game chat. Choose Tap, click +, and assign the Y key.\nAdd a delay between opening the chat and typing the message (otherwise the text may not type correctly). Click Add action again, choose Delay (ms), and set the delay to 100 ms.\nActions are executed from top to bottom. Keep this in mind when building macros. If you need to reorder actions, use the up/down arrow buttons on the left side of the action you want to move.\nAdd the action that types the message text. Click Add action, choose Text, and enter Hello! in the text field on the right.\nAdd a delay between typing the message and sending it. Click Add action, choose Delay (ms), and set the delay to 100 ms.\nThis delay is optional in this example, but for some other tasks it’s better to use it to ensure correct macro timing.\nAdd the action that sends the message, then save the macro. Click Add action, choose Tap, click +, and assign Enter.\nWhen you finish creating the macro, click Save in the bottom-right corner.\nMacros are saved to the keyboard’s internal memory and will also work on another PC. When saving a macro, Vial may ask you to unlock the keyboard by holding two keys in the top-left corner.\nAssign the created macro key to the layout. In this example, assign macro M1 to a key on Layer 3: go to the Keymap tab in the top menu, select Layer 3, select the desired key on the layout, then in the bottom Macros tab click M1.\nChoose any layer and key position that’s convenient for triggering the macro; see the layer section above for how to create layers.\nMore information about Macros can be found in the official QMK documentation.","installation#Installation":"To reflash/update the keypad firmware, you need to put it into bootloader mode.

Let’s start with configuring standard ones.","combo#Combo":"Combo allows you to assign a Behavior to the simultaneous pressing of several keys. For example, you can assign the simultaneous pressing of the C and V keys to switch the keyboard layout, or some macro, often this is more convenient than assigning a key in a layer.\nTo create a Combo, go to the Combos tab and click Add New Combo.\nLet’s consider an example with a Combo of the C and V keys to change the layout language. In the opened window, we need to select the positions of the keys, pressing which will lead to the activation of the combo. To do this, simply click on the positions where the C and V keys are located.\nFill in the name of the combo (in the screenshot “lang”), and select the Behavior when the combo is activated. \u0026kp pressing Space with the GUI modifier held down is suitable for changing the layout language.\nClick on the Create button and the combo is ready to use!\nBy clicking on the button with the wrench, we can make additional settings for the Combo, for example, change the trigger timeout, or specify on which specific layers the Combo will work (by default, combos work on all layers). You can read more about these settings in the ZMK documentation.","copying-layers#Copying layers":"Another useful layer management feature is copying them. To make a copy, click on the … button next to the layer name and select Duplicate Layer. After clicking, a full copy of the layer will be created.","custom-behaviors#Custom Behaviors":"In this section, we can create our own custom Behavior based on standard ones. Let’s create a Behavior that will be convenient to implement Home Row Mods (hereinafter HRM), a popular approach to layout design, the main idea of which is that the keys of the home row (A, S, D, F and J, K, L, ;), when held down, activate the modifiers Shift, Ctrl, Gui or Alt. Click Add New Behavior, in the opened window select Hold or Tap behavior.\nIn this window, you need to describe the template of what Behaviors will be performed when tapped and held, as well as several properties. Fill in the properties:\nBind: “hrm”. The name of the behavior, this is what we can use to find the behavior when assigning it to a key; bindings — HOLD: \u0026kp. When holding the key down, the key with the modifier will be pressed, an ordinary \u0026kp is suitable for this; bindings — TAP: \u0026kp. Action for a short press, \u0026kp is also suitable for pressing a key with a letter; tapping-term-ms: 200. If the key is pressed less than 200 milliseconds, then the keyboard will register TAP and the key, for example D, will be pressed. If the key is held down more than 200 milliseconds, then HOLD will be registered and the modifier specified in the parameters, for example Ctrl, will be pressed; flavor: balanced. There are several algorithms that allow you to use HRM without strictly relying on the timing from tapping-term-ms, balanced is just one of them. It implies that if the HRM key was pressed for less than 200 milliseconds, but during the HRM key press another key was pressed and released, then you need to register the HOLD action. In the ZMK documentation there is an example of creating an HRM that does not depend on timings at all, without interfering with the typing technique and key rolls. The idea is that the modifiers are strictly pressed on one half, and the key with the letter on the other half. The example describes the properties in the form of code, but in keymap-editor all the properties have the same names and they are easy to adapt.\nAfter filling in the properties, click Okay, and we see that our custom Behavior has been successfully created.\nNext, go to the Layers tab, and assign the created behavior to the D key. In the Behavior assignment window, we need to find and select the created \u0026hrm.\nFill in the parameters:\nIn Parameters — HOLD you need to specify the key code of the desired modifier, specify Ctrl. In Parameters — TAP you need to specify the key code of the key sent by tap, select D. An interesting idea might be to assign the HRM modifier Ctrl to the S key, because then pressing the very frequently used combinations Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V is very convenient with one hand, try it!\nAfter filling in the parameters, click Okay and our first Home Row Mod is assigned! Similarly, we assign HRM modifiers to all other keys, and all modifiers are already under the fingertips, you no longer have to move your hand to get them.\nTip: you can create several Behaviors with different Tapping Term for different fingers. For example, for the little finger (which is weaker than the index finger) it is worth setting a larger Tapping Term value so that accidental presses are not registered as HOLD.","getting-started-with-keymap-editor#Getting started with keymap-editor":"Keymap-editor is a web application, accessible from a browser at https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/. To use it, you need to meet several conditions:\nThe user must be registered on https://github.com/ The user needs a fork of the repository https://github.com/ergohaven/ergohaven-zmk-config In the fork, you need to enable GitHub Actions to automatically build the firmware after making changes to the layout. Go to the Actions tab and click the I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable Actions button.\nGo to https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/, on the opened page, select GitHub, authorize, and grant access to the created fork for Keymap Editor.

Then click Save to commit the access settings changes.\nOnce the steps described above are completed, the layout is ready for changes, hooray! Go to https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/ and you will see the default layout.","layers#Layers":"Split keyboards use layers, which are a kind of additional modifiers, like Shift or Control. By switching the keyboard to another layer, pressing the keys will register other symbols or functions assigned to that key on that layer. Sounds complicated, let’s look at an example: If you press and hold the red key on the left half, the keyboard will switch to layer 1, and pressing, for example, the W key will send the 2 key press to the OS, because in the default layout it is assigned to the W position on the 1st layer.","lt#\u0026amp;lt":"\u003c - a hybrid Behavior of a standard key press (\u0026kp) and layer activation while the key is held down (\u0026mo). For example, on the red key, which has \u0026mo 1 in the standard layout, we assign \u003c, passing the following parameters: 1st layer and the Space key code. Then, pressing it will type a space, and holding it down will change the layer, pure magic!\nIt is worth noting that in this way we reduced the number of used keys on the 0th layer, because initially \u0026kp Space and \u0026mo 1 were on two separate keys pressed with the thumb, we have combined them into one, and now you can place some other Behavior in place of \u0026kp Space.","macro-execution-cycle#Macro execution cycle":"Macros in ZMK are executed in 2 steps:\nActions when the macro is pressed, Actions when the macro is released. Initially, this is not noticeable, because without a specific Control Binding, all actions are performed immediately when pressed. To learn how to distinguish between these 2 steps, we will need the following Control Bindings:\n¯o_press - for subsequent presses sets the mode in which the specified key will be pressed, but will not be released; ¯o_release - for subsequent presses sets the mode in which the specified key will be released; ¯o_tap - for subsequent presses sets the mode in which the specified key will be pressed, and after the time specified in tap_time, will be released (default mode); ¯o_tap_time - sets the time between pressing and releasing each key in the macro (30 ms by default); ¯o_pause_for_release - at this point, the Macro will stop its execution until the Macro key is released. By applying the listed Control Bindings, you can create a macro that, when pressed, switches the layer, presses a certain modifier, then waits for the macro to be released, and after that returns the layer back and releases the modifier. It turns out a key that combines \u0026mo and \u0026kp, two in one!","macros#Macros":"With the help of Macros you can save some frequently used sequence of key combinations and call this sequence by pressing just one key, for example, make a Macro that types various templates, like this:\n```\n```\nat the end, the macro can also move the cursor to the middle of this template, saving a lot of presses!\nLet’s analyze the creation of such a Macro as an example. Go to the Macros tab, and click Add New Macro. In the opened window, enter the name of the Macro, for example, enter “template” and click Create.\nNext, we need to compose the actions that the Macro will perform. To make the macro type the symbol ` three times, we use the \u0026kp Behavior three times. When creating a macro, a cell for one Behavior is immediately added, let’s add 2 more by pressing the Add Key Binding button twice, and assign \u0026kp ` in all three cells.\nNext, we need to make a line break twice, again write the symbol ` three times and as the last step press the ↑ key to move the cursor to the center of the template.\nIn total, it turns out 9 presses, as many as 9 presses are reduced to just 1! By default, ZMK will press each key for 30 ms, and there will be a pause of 15 ms between each press so that the OS has time to process each press. To make the actions work for sure (in all sorts of slow corporate messengers, remote desktops and jiras), and also to make the actions performed by the Macro a little more readable, we divide them into groups by adding an additional pause of 10 ms. To do this, click Add Control Binding and move the appeared ¯o_press after the first three presses of `. Now we must not forget to change ¯o_press to ¯o_wait_time. To do this, click on it and select ¯o_wait_time, in the Raw Value parameter specify 10, this is the number of milliseconds that the macro will wait.\nSuch a delay may not be enough when working on remote desktops, and if this happens, you can increase the time of each press and the delay in the macro parameters, they are opened by clicking on the button with the wrench icon.\nIt already looks more readable, let’s add the same ¯o_wait_time after two presses of Enter and after the second group of presses of `.\nBeauty, now it is visually clear what the Macro does. We only have to assign the Macro to a key or Combo, and you can use it!\nMacro is a Behavior, and you need to select it in the Behavior field.","mo#\u0026amp;mo":"\u0026mo - enables the specified layer while the key is held down. This Behavior is used in default layout, \u0026mo 1 is assigned to the red key, and holding it down enables the 1st layer.","mod-morph#\u003ccode\u003e\u0026amp;mod-morph\u003c/code\u003e":"Mod Morph allows you to add your own custom key press processing if it is pressed with active modifiers Shift, Ctrl, Alt or Gui.\nIf you assign the Mod Morph from the screenshot to a key, then when you press without modifiers, Q will be typed, and when you hold down the Alt modifier, Esc will be typed. Instead of Esc there can be any Behavior, for example changing the layer, or a macro! This behavior is a more flexible analogue of Key Overrides from Vial.","moving-layers#Moving layers":"Sometimes when configuring a layout, it becomes necessary to change the layer order number. In keymap-editor, this is implemented very conveniently, just drag the layer to the desired position.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. When moving a layer in this way, keymap-editor automatically adjusts the parameters of all Behaviors that previously activated this layer. For example, if the layout has \u0026mo 2, if you move the 2nd layer to the position of the 1st layer, the assigned key \u0026mo 2 will automatically change to \u0026mo 1.","mt#\u003ccode\u003e\u0026amp;mt\u003c/code\u003e":"The Mod/Tap Behavior allows you to assign a specific Behavior to a short press (TAP) of a key, and another Behavior to a hold (HOLD) of a key. (Analog of LShift_T, LCtrl_T, etc. keys from the Quantum tab in Vial) By default, a short press is considered a press lasting less than 200 milliseconds. If you hold it longer, then a hold is registered.\nIf you configure the Behavior as in the screenshot above, then when you short press the key, the letter D will be typed, and when you hold it, the Left Shift will be held down.","parameterized-macros#Parameterized macros":"Macros in ZMK have an interesting feature, they can be parameterized. To use parameters, you need to apply one or more of the listed Control Bindings:\n¯o_param_1to1 - to the next Behavior in the macro, the value from parameter 1 of the Macro will be passed as parameter 1; ¯o_param_1to2 - to the next Behavior in the macro, the value from parameter 1 of the Macro will be passed as parameter 2; ¯o_param_2to1 - to the next Behavior in the macro, the value from parameter 2 of the Macro will be passed as parameter 1; ¯o_param_2to2 - to the next Behavior in the macro, the value from parameter 2 of the Macro will be passed as parameter 2. Let’s consider an example, implementing a Macro that, when pressed, activates the layer passed in the parameter, presses the modifier passed in the parameter, waits for the key to be released, and then turns off the passed layer and releases the modifier passed in the parameter. Let’s call the Macro \u0026ml (mod-layer), it will look like this:\n¯o_param_1to1 and ¯o_param_2to1 are selected because the used Behaviors \u0026mo and \u0026kp have one input parameter each.\nIt is worth paying attention to how the Macro is assigned in the layout. In the Behavior list, find the created Macro \u0026ml, after selecting it, we need to fill in the parameters:\nLayer - this is the layer that will be passed as a parameter for \u0026mo, select 2; Key Code - this is the key passed to \u0026kp, it will be pressed simultaneously with \u0026mo, we planned to use a modifier, so select LShift. That’s it, the macro is ready to use! The beauty of such a macro is that it can be used in several places in the layout, specifying any layer to switch to, and any modifier.\nWhen creating a custom Hold or Tap behavior, in bindings — HOLD and TAP you can specify any Behaviors, even parameterized macros - this is very flexible, because when you hold the key, any actions will be performed, whatever comes to mind. For example, in the ZMK documentation there is such an idea: a parameterized macro in which, when the layer is activated, the color of the RGB backlight also changes to the one specified in the parameter, that is, probably, after K:03 and Imperial move to the ZMK rails, it will be possible to select the LED color for different layers! And you can combine this not only with layers, but with anything, even with modifiers!","quick-key-assignment#Quick key assignment":"On any layer, you can quickly remap keys by clicking on the … button next to the layer name and selecting Quick \u0026kp Assignment.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

Click the Add Behavior Reconfiguration button, in the opened menu select, for example, \u0026sl.\nIn the opened Reconfigure \u0026sl window, we see standard properties that we can change. Let’s increase the timeout for \u0026sl so that the layer remains active not for 1 second, but for 3. To do this, in the release-after-ms property line, click the Override button and enter 3000 in the appeared field (the units of measurement in the field are milliseconds), and click Okay.\nThe \u0026sl entry with overridden properties appeared in the Reconfigure section. To view the properties, click the Edit button. To completely return the properties to their default values, click the Delete button. Detailed information about all properties of Behaviors in the ZMK documentation.","remapping-keys#Remapping keys":"To remap a key, click on it, and a window will open to select a new Behavior for this key.\nIn the window, you need to select a Behavior for this key. Behavior is an entity in ZMK that determines what action will be performed when the key is pressed, for example, \u0026kp (Key Press) simply sends a key press to the OS. Each \u0026kp has a Key Code parameter, in which we specify which specific key will be pressed. In the screenshot above, the Q key is specified in this parameter. If we want to assign Z instead of Q, for example, we need to click on the Key Code field.\nThe window expands and the right side displays a list of key codes available for assignment. In the search bar for available key codes, enter Z, select Z among the filtered codes, click Okay and it’s done, the key has been replaced!\nAbove the list of keycodes are checkboxes with modifiers Shift, Alt, Ctrl, and Gui, with prefixes “L” and “R” indicating the left or right modifier. If you check one of the modifier checkboxes, a key combination with the checked modifier will be sent to the OS. For example, if we checked the LCtrl checkbox in the window above, pressing the key would immediately send the LCtrl + Z combination. Convenient, we make a key combination with one key press!\nNext, the changes must be saved. Click Save in the upper left corner. If desired, you can give the change a name to remind you which changes to keymap were made, or leave the field blank and click Commit.\nThe firmware has automatically started building, this process usually takes about two minutes. Click on the blue button with the build status.\nThe opened page displays the statuses of all build stages. After all stages are completed, an Artifacts section will appear, containing the firmware archive. Click on it to download.\nAfter downloading the firmware archive, flash the keyboard with the files from it, following the steps described in the First steps with a Keyboard on ZMK (see the “Keyboard firmware” section).\nChanges to the layout have been made!","renaming-layers#Renaming layers":"You can change the names of layers, this can make it easier to configure the layout.

(analog of OSL() from Vial) It is convenient to use this Behavior to switch to a layer with function keys, because most often they need to be pressed 1 time. Pressed \u0026sl 3 (on this layer in the default layout are F1-12 keys), the layer turned on, pressed the F1 key, and the layer immediately turned off automatically.\nIt is also important to mention that if no press occurs within 1 second after switching to a layer via \u0026sl, the layer will automatically turn off. This timeout is configured in the Behaviors -\u003e Reconfiguration section, more details in the Behaviors section.","switching-layers#Switching layers":"In ZMK, there are several Behaviors for switching layers:","td#\u003ccode\u003e\u0026amp;td\u003c/code\u003e":"Tap Dance assigns different Behaviors depending on how many times in a row the key has been tapped.\nIf you assign the Tap Dance from the screenshot to a key, then pressing the key once will type the letter Q, and pressing it twice will press Esc.

This Behavior is very convenient for switching to a layer by pressing, because unlike \u0026tog, the \u0026to Behavior turns off all active layers, and there is no need to separately disable the current active layer. Example: being on the 0th layer, \u0026to 2 is pressed - layer 2 is enabled, we can switch to the 1st layer by pressing \u0026to 1, because this behavior, in addition to enabling layer 1, disables all other enabled layers, in this case the 2nd.","tog#\u0026amp;tog":"\u0026tog - when pressed, toggles the state of the layer, turns on the specified layer if it is off, and vice versa, turns it off if it is on. (analog of TG() from Vial) When using this Behavior, it is worth remembering that the active layer at the moment is the enabled layer with the highest number, by turning on layer 2 by pressing \u0026tog 2, it is impossible to switch to layer 1 by pressing \u0026mo or \u0026tog, because it has a lower number, and despite the fact that pressing \u0026tog 1 will enable layer 1, the active layer will still be layer 2 because it has a higher number. To switch to layers with a number lower than the 2nd layer, you have to place the \u0026tog 2 key on the 2nd layer. To consolidate, let’s analyze the scenario of working with \u0026tog step by step:\nBeing on the 0th layer, \u0026tog 2 is pressed - layer 2 is enabled, it will not be possible to switch to the 1st layer by pressing \u0026tog 1 or \u0026mo 1; Being on the 2nd layer, \u0026tog 2 is pressed - layer 2 is disabled, the keyboard returned to the 0th layer, and we can switch to the 1st layer.","useful-custom-behaviors#Useful custom behaviors":"To create keys with the Behaviors listed below, you need to create a new custom Behavior with the appropriate type."},"title":"Keyboard configuration in ZMK keymap-editor"},"/en/zmk/zmk-keyboards/":{"data":{"":"This article provides a guide to help you take your first steps in mastering a keyboard on ZMK.

Important! The firmware of the halves have differences, and the left half must be flashed with a file whose name ends in left.uf2, and the right half with a file ending in right.uf2. In most cases you can just flash only the master halve (right one for Velvet v3 UI edition, and left for OP36 and Velvet v3) as it stores the keymap.\nYou can switch the keyboard to firmware mode not only by double-clicking Reset, but also by pressing the \u0026bootloader key.

However, it is possible to simulate this function using layers.\nTo recreate the Caps Word behavior, you will need to:\nDuplicate the ru layer, it is most convenient to do this in keymap-editor, by clicking ••• -\u003e Duplicate layer. Add the LShift modifier to all keys that print letters. Thus, when you get to this layer, all printed letters will be capitalized. In the example, we will consider activating the Caps Word mode by pressing the “C” + “V” key combo. For the en layer, we will create a combo with the standard \u0026caps_word behavior, the combo should only be activated on the en layer. For the ru layer, we will create a combo with the \u0026tog 2 behavior (2 is the number of the cw_ru layer), on the “C” + “V” keys, we will limit this combo to only trigger on the ru and cw_ru layers. To recreate the activation of Caps Word by pressing LShift + RShift, as in wired keyboards on QMK, you can use the mod-morph behavior.\nNext, we will make the cw_ru layer turn off after pressing the spacebar, for this we will create a parameterized macro \u0026cw_off. The first action of the macro will return the keyboard to the ru layer by pressing \u0026to 1, the second action will press the symbol passed in the parameter. We assign the created macro \u0026cw_off to the cw_ru layer in place of \u0026kp SPACE, specifying a space in the parameter, and that’s it, we have recreated the Caps Word behavior for the Russian language.\nSimilarly, you can recreate the RuEn word feature from the RuEn implementation in QMK, we just create a separate layer for this feature, select a key to switch to this layer, and also a key that will turn off this layer. You can also implement, for example, Num Word to enter several digits and switch back to the letter layer, it may be useful if you often enter IP addresses, because you can configure the Num Word layer not to turn off when you press periods.","combo#Combo":"Configuring the layers on which this combo is active will help us implement printing symbols from any language in the combo. Let’s create a combo that prints the symbol “#” when the “N” + “M” keys are pressed. To implement the ruen behavior in the case of the symbol “#”, we will need to create 2 separate combos: one will describe the actions necessary to print the symbol if the Russian language is currently active, the second combo will describe the actions in the case if the English language is currently active.\nCombo for the Russian language. To print the symbol “#” in Russian, we will need the macro \u0026en since “#” is not in the Russian layout, we select the macro and pass the keycode HASH in the parameter. To set the layers on which the combo is active, you need to click the button with the wrench icon, click it and select the ru and sym_ru layers. Combo for the English language. The symbol “#” is in the English layout, we assign the regular \u0026kp HASH as the action for the combo. We also configure the combo to be active only on the en and sym_en layers.","displaying-cyrillic-in-keymap-editor#Displaying Cyrillic in keymap-editor":"For the convenience of modifying the layout in the firmware, the ruen keycodes aliases, such as RU_COMMA or RU_CYRILLIC_TSE, have been added, displaying the symbols of the Russian layout on the layout, while pressing RU_COMMA in the OS will transmit the scan code SC_SLASH since in the standard QWERTY layout the period is located on the slash key.\nThese keycodes facilitate visual understanding of the layout, while RU_COMMA is simply an alias for the keycode SLASH, and if the English layout is enabled in the OS when RU_COMMA is pressed, a slash will be printed.\nIt is very convenient to configure layouts other than QWERTY with these keycodes-aliases.","getting-started#Getting Started":"For Ergohaven keyboards, layouts have been prepared that contain the macros necessary for configuration; these layouts have the _ruen postfix in their name.\nYou can take the ruen layout as a basis, or if you already have a lot of developments in your layout, just create the same macros in it and create separate layers for each language.\nWhen transferring macros to your layout, also pay attention to the parameters of the macros displayed when you click on the button with the wrench icon, it is important not to forget to transfer the Wait (ms) and Tap (ms) settings.\nMacros in the ruen layout are oriented towards using combinations for unconditional language switching, Ctrl + Shift + 1 to enable English, and Ctrl + Shift + 2 to enable Russian (similar to RuEn M1M2 mode from Vial). This approach requires additional configuration on the OS side, but it greatly simplifies the synchronization of the language in the keyboard with the language in the OS. If this language switching approach does not suit you for some reason, the ruen approach gets along well with the standard key combination GUI + Space, described in more detail in the Toggle Language Switching section (similar to RuEn M0 and RuEn Default modes from Vial).","how-ruen-works#How RuEn Works":"Let’s divide the symbols into 2 groups and analyze each one separately.","macros#Macros":"Macros also go well with the ruen approach, allowing you to print symbolic constructions or text templates regardless of the current language. Let’s consider the example of a macro that will print two curly braces {}, and press the left arrow to move the cursor between the braces. To print curly braces regardless of the language, we will need to create two separate macros for each language.\nWe will assign the macro call to the “J” + “L” key combo, this arrangement will be easy to remember, because the curly braces on the symbol layer are in the same places.\nIf using a combo is inconvenient, you can simply assign these macros to the appropriate keys on the corresponding language layers.\nWe create a combo, configure the layers on which this combo is active, and that’s it, curly braces are available in any language on the base layer!\nIt may also be convenient to use similar combos for square brackets, parentheses (parentheses are in the same places in both languages and do not require the creation of 2 macros) and double quotes.","main-idea#Main Idea":"In general, printing a symbol works like this: the keyboard sends information that a key in a specific position has been pressed, and the OS receives this press and prints the necessary symbol depending on the current layout in the OS. Let’s consider some examples. The “KC_Q” key is pressed on the keyboard\nif the standard English layout is selected in the OS, the letter “Q” will be printed; if the standard Russian layout is selected in the OS, the letter “Й” will be printed. The presence of different letters in different layouts is mostly a familiar thing, although there are also phonetic layouts in which, for example, the letter “О” is placed in the same place in Russian and English, this reduces the cognitive load of memorizing different layouts, but words in Russian and English are constructed differently, and a phonetic layout will be less convenient for typing.\nThe “SLASH” key is pressed on the keyboard\nif the standard English layout is selected in the OS, a slash “/” will be printed; if the standard Russian layout is selected in the OS, a period “.” will be printed. The “DOT” key is pressed on the keyboard\nif the standard English layout is selected in the OS, a period “.” will be printed; if the standard Russian layout is selected in the OS, the letter “Ю” will be printed. The “LEFT_BRACE” key is pressed on the keyboard\nif the standard English layout is selected in the OS, the symbol “{” will be printed; if the standard Russian layout is selected in the OS, the letter “Х” will be printed. The problem is identified - in the standard OS layouts, the period, and many other symbols, are printed by completely different keys, and some symbols, such as “{” do not exist in the Russian layout at all. Let’s consider possible solutions to the problem of unifying the location of symbols. There are two ways to solve this:\non the OS side, by installing a layout on the computer in which the symbols are on the same key, for example https://github.com/braindefender/universal-layout, but here it is worth considering that the layout must be installed on each computer, as well as on remote desktops to which you connect; on the keyboard side, by configuring the layout using the RuEn approach, there is also a disadvantage here in that these settings are located specifically in the keyboard and on the built-in keyboard of the laptop, the symbols in different languages will be located on different keys. The article below describes how to solve the problem on the keyboard side using the RuEn approach.","switching-via-gui--space-without-the-need-for-synchronization#Switching via GUI + Space without the need for synchronization":"It is possible to get rid of the need for manual language synchronization when using switching by pressing GUI + Space using a hybrid of switching by the toggle model and switching by separate key combinations, as is done with the combo in the ruen layout by default, you will still need to configure separate combinations in the OS, but you can press the usual key combination to switch the language.\nWe configure the key combinations Ctrl + Shift + 1 in the OS to enable English, and Ctrl + Shift + 2 to enable Russian and create two mod-morph behaviors:\n\u0026en_space: without modifiers, pressing \u0026kp Space, with the LGUI modifier, calling the macro \u0026layer_en; \u0026ru_space: without modifiers, pressing \u0026kp Space, with the LGUI modifier, calling the macro \u0026layer_ru. Next, we assign the \u0026ru_space behavior instead of \u0026kp Space on the en layer, and the \u0026en_space behavior instead of \u0026kp Space on the ru layer. Now, when you press GUI + Space, the language will be switched in the OS and the language in the keyboard will be synchronized at the same time.","symbol-layer#Symbol Layer":"On the basic layers ru and en, there are certainly not enough buttons for all the necessary symbols, and in general it may be more convenient to place the symbols on a separate symbol layer, to apply the ruen approach to create a separate symbol layer, you will need to create 2 separate layers, one for printing symbols while in Russian, and the second for printing symbols while in English. In the ruen layout, these are the sym_en and sym_ru layers by default.\nTo maintain synchronization of languages in the OS and keyboard, the transition to sym_ru must occur from the ru layer, and to sym_en from the en layer, thus the keyboard will understand which language is currently active, and will send actions corresponding to the current language to print the symbol.\nThe \u0026sl behavior is also great for switching to language symbol layers, activating the symbol layer with one press, and then returning the user to the previous active layer, if necessary, such a key can be held down and it will work like a regular \u0026mo.","symbols-that-appear-in-both-languages#Symbols that appear in both languages":"The first group is symbols that appear in both languages, but are located on different keys, such as a period or a question mark. To combine the location of such symbols, we need to somehow let the keyboard know what language is currently in the OS, so that the keyboard presses the key corresponding to the language. For example, if we want to unify the position of the period, then in Russian the keyboard needs to send the SLASH key press to the OS, and in English DOT.\nThe layer functionality is perfect for solving this problem, we can configure it so that the layer in the keyboard switches at the same time as the language in the OS, and then it will perform the function of a variable, depending on this variable, the code of the desired key will be sent. As the variable described earlier, the ruen layout has 2 separate layers en and ru. To place the period on the same key, we do the following:\nOn the en layer, assign the \u0026kp DOT behavior to the desired key On the ru layer, assign the \u0026kp SLASH behavior to the same position To switch the language, you only need to use the \u0026layer_en and \u0026layer_ru macros. The \u0026layer_ru macro will send the key combination Ctrl + Shift + 2 to the OS, thus the OS will switch to the Russian language and at the same time the keyboard will switch to the ru layer, thus the OS and the keyboard will be synchronously in the Russian layout, similarly the \u0026layer_en macro will send the combination Ctrl + Shift + 1 to the OS to enable the English layout, and switch the keyboard to the en layer. In the ruen layout, these macros are assigned to the “E” + “R” key combo by default. Being on the ru layer, pressing the “E” + “R” combo will switch the language in the OS to English and change the layer to en, and being on the en layer, pressing the combo will do the opposite, the language in the OS will switch to Russian, the layer will change to ru.\nThe \u0026layer_en and \u0026layer_ru macros can be assigned to any place in the layout, for example to two different keys or two different combos “E” + “R” and “U” + “I”.\nThe goal has been achieved, now the period is printed in both languages by pressing the same key.","symbols-that-appear-in-only-one-of-the-languages#Symbols that appear in only one of the languages":"The second group is symbols that are only in the layout of one of the languages, for example the symbol “\u0026” is only in the English layout. To print a symbol from this group while in the Russian layout, you need to do the following:\nSwitch the language in the OS to English by pressing Ctrl + Shift + 1;\nPress the key combination to print the symbol, in the case of the symbol \u0026, this key combination is Shift + 7;\nSwitch the language in the OS back to Russian by pressing Ctrl + Shift + 2.\nAll these actions are contained in the parameterized macro \u0026en from the ruen layout. We simply assign the macro to a key on the ru layer, and specify the keycode AMPS, or the key combination Shift + 7 as a parameter.\nIn some situations, it may be useful to hold down the key with the symbol, and the \u0026en macro from the ruen layout will correctly handle this press, holding the symbol in the English layout.\nBut what if English is currently enabled, because if we use this macro on it, the symbol “\u0026” will be printed and the last step will switch the language to Russian? The layer functionality in the keyboard helps us again with the solution to this problem. Being in English, in order to print this symbol, there is no need to switch to another language, and we can simply assign the standard behavior \u0026kp AMPS to the desired key.\nThere are not very many symbols that are only in the Russian layout, and there is no macro for them in the ruen layout, but if you suddenly wanted to print the symbol “№” in any layout, you can create a macro \u0026ru by copying the macro \u0026en and swapping the key combinations for switching the language in the OS.","toggle-language-switching#Toggle Language Switching":"Full RuEn operation can also be achieved using standard key combinations for switching the language in the OS, such as GUI + Space, Ctrl + Space. To achieve this, when you press the language switching key combination, we must also switch the layer in the keyboard.\nLet’s consider how to implement this using the example of the GUI + Space combination. The first step is to create a macro \u0026lg_tog consisting of two actions - pressing GUI + Space and \u0026tog 1. \u0026tog 1 will enable the ru layer if we are on the en layer, and vice versa, will enable en if ru is currently active. With this macro, we simultaneously toggle both the language in the OS and the layer in the keyboard.\nNext, in order to get out of situations when the ru layer is enabled on the keyboard, and English is in the OS, we need a way to synchronize the language states. To do this, you can assign the \u0026tog 1 behavior to one of the keys, and when a desynchronization occurs - just press this key and the states will be synchronized again.\nThe toggle model approach is not preferred precisely because of the need to separately synchronize the OS language states with the keyboard. Having 2 separate key combinations for languages, synchronization occurs regularly, when \u0026layer_en or \u0026layer_ru is pressed.\nThe next step is to make the macro \u0026lg_tog created earlier triggered when the GUI + Space combination is pressed on the keyboard, for this we will need the mod-morph behavior from ZMK.\nCreate a new custom behavior of the Mod Morph Behavior type; Name it “lg_space”; When \u0026lg_space is pressed without the “LGUI” modifier, the NORMAL action will be triggered and \u0026kp SPACE will be pressed; If the “LGUI” modifier was held down when \u0026lg_space was pressed, then MODIFIED will be triggered and the macro \u0026lg_tog will be called. We also need to change the key combination for changing the language in the \u0026to_ru and \u0026to_en macros, since these macros are used in the \u0026en macro, which is used for printing symbols.\nThe last step is to assign the created mod-morph instead of the regular space on the desired layers, and that’s it, the language states in the OS and keyboard will be switched synchronously.\nAndroid devices also use the GUI + Space key combination to switch the language, if you choose this switching method, then ruen will also work on your phone and tablet."},"title":"RuEn Layout for Wireless Keyboards"}}
